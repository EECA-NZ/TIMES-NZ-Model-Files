this data is from 
https://www.emi.ea.govt.nz/Retail/Reports/GUEHMT

We download all the distributed data for SOLAR for each market segment (res/com/ind), full timeseries, by regional council
These are saved as specific csv files (eg solar_residential.csv)
The data nicely comes with all the relevant variables (new capacity, total capacity, ICPs, average size, etc)

This was a slightly quick job. It would likely be better to find a link to the EMI api and automate updates.
