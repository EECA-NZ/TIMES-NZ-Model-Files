# RBS Enhancement 1: Power Demand Tables and Charts		
This spreadsheet provides the ability to produce data tables and charts of residential demand and generation based on the selection of various parameters		
The data is output from a model of annual energy use in the residential sector and demand profiles for selected energy end use categories or groups of products		
        
## Overview		
Data in this data is for residential demand (total behind the meter demand) and generation (gross) only		
Data is based on data analysis for the update of the Residential Baseline Study (RBS2.0) completed in 2022		
It is based on actual data up until 2020 or 2021 and projections out to 2040 that were developed as part of the RBS2.0 modelling		
Raw data for the production of the charts is contained in the sheet Demand.Data and is derived from the RBS model		
Results are "typical demand", not maximum or minimum figures		
        
## Definitions		
The spreadsheet allows the selection of a region, season, day type and year and then produces demand and generation data for those parameters on an hourly basis across a day, i.e. the demand and generation profile from midnight to midnight		
"Region" allows the selection of any Australian state or territory, or New Zealand.		
"Season" allows the selection of Autumn (Mar to May), Spring (Sep to Nov), Summer (Dec to Feb), or Winter (Jun to Aug)		
"Day Type" allows the selection of a weekday (WD, i.e. Monday to Friday) or a weekend day (WE, i.e. Saturday or Sunday)		
        
## Product/End Use Categories		
The data comprises a number of product/end use categories for separating out the load, or generation in the case of home based electricity generation.  These include:		
 - Water heating	Electric, gas, solar (incl those with electric or gas boost) or wood (wetback) options	
- Transport	Electric vehicles charging at home	
- Space conditioning	Electric (including aircon and electric resistance), gas (LPG and mains gas) and wood	
- Lighting	Incandescent, halogen, compact fluorescent and LED	
- Cooking	Ovens, microwaves and stoves	
- White goods	Refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers and clothes washers/dryers	
- Other equipment	e.g. pool pumps, battery chargers, miscellaneous kitchen appliances	
- IT&HE	Information technology and home entertainment e.g. computers, televisions	
- Generation	Gross generation (rooftop solar PV)

## Data Sources		
A number of datasets were used to develop this power demand by time analysis, as below:		
Australia 		
·        Solar Analytics data set - monitored half-hourly energy consumption loads from 6300 sites across Australia. 		
·        Sustainability Victoria (SV) - Residential energy measurement from monitoring studies conducted as part of the household retrofit trials		
·        NCC/Sustainability Victoria - Profiling factors from SV's whole of home tool		
·        Australian Energy Market Operator – Integrated System Plan 2021, for electric vehicle charging profiles		
·        CSIRO household monitoring study (2012-2017)		
New Zealand		
·        University of Otago/Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) Green Grid Household Electricity Demand Study 2014-2018.  		
    
## Further information		
Further information on the sourcing, production and analysis of RBS 2.0 data is held in the RBS Methodology report		
        
## Limitations		
The key limitation of the Power demand by time profiles is that they are static profiles - i.e. they are based on the demand profile research conducted during the period 2012-2020 and on energy use modelling.  The projected profiles for future years will reflect forecasts of changes in residential appliance stock, hence total energy use, but will not reflect changes in consumers’ behaviour regarding how appliances are used.  The accuracy of profiles will also reflect the varying accuracy of the demand profile research with regard to specific product types.
