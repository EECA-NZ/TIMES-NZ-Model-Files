SNZ best data on current population is ERP (not census CURP!) so this should always be the series we use for historical records (as at June)

This series is available on infoshare:
Group: Population Estimates - DPE
Table: Estimated Resident Population for Regional Council Areas, at 30 June (1996+) (Annual-Jun)


Population projections are from ADE. This is quite awkward because they seemed to have stopped doing the subnational projections 

We therefore use 2018 subnational projections and apply the regional shares for each year to the current 2024 base projections
