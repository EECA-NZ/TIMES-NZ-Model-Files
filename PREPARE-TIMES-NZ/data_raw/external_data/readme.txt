all files in this folder should have a brief description somewhere.

We can put these here but they will probably go in a proper method readme at some point. 

the files should be renamed to be clearer though! 

i wonder if mbie will provide flat files for the balances, that would be nice 


All data is stored as csv files, either from direct downloads or extracted from downloaded excel files.
All file links are stored here for reference, including the webpage with available context and the link to the actual file. 

In the cases where we have extracted data into csv files, these are not touched or altered in any way after copy-pasting into csvs. All handling is scripted 
Alternative method: just keep the excel files? Maybe that's better. Not sure. 

All the csv files have been renamed so it's clear at a glance where they're from and what they are.
