tech_codes.csv joins on the combination of FuelType and TechnologyCode from our main data to add: 

Technology names (for aligning with input assumptions)
TIMES fuel codes (for aligning with internal TIMES elc fuels and defining input commodities)
TIMES tech names (for generating consistent process names) 

These are for the base year only, but the future techs should have consistent treatment. 
Ideally we'd have a single input file covering everything - little bit more tweaking to get there.
