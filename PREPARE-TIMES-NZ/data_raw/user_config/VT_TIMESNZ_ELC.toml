# Sector Fuels 

# This sheet: 

# 1: Defines commodities that can be used for electricity generation (eg ELCNGA)
# 2: Defines the processes that can convert other TIMES Commodities into these fuels (eg NGA -> ELCNGA)
# Note that these are effectively dummy processes for modelling, and so should not contain technical parameters. 
# The processes are defined with 'PRE' settings (meaning 'miscellaneous') 

# 3: Defines technical parameters for these proceses (barely used). 


# NOTE: it is possible to add a VAROM to these processes to represent fuel delivery costs.
#  However, these are now set to each electricity generating process separately 
# (some plants have higher dlivery costs than others) by setting VAR_FLO costs on the process itself - this is the approach we have used, given the MBIE data on delivery costs.
