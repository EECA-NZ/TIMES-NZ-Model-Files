Note: All toml files in user_config and any child folders are assumed to be config files for producing TIMES excel sheets 
So those toml files must adhere to the rules for those config files or something will break.

All non toml files in user_config (inlcuding this readme) are ignored so you can do what you want as long as the extension is not .toml
