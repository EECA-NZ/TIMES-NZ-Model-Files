ERP2 baseline:

We specifically use "new measures", as this includes a policy change to limit auction volumes.
Following stakeholder feedback, we believe the price path's decline to the marginal cost of forestry is unrealistic in terms of implied land use.
We therefore assume that the price stabilises at approximately 80 NZD/t rather than declining to 50 NZD/t
