This directory contains raw model results output by Veda for each scenario.
They have been converted to csv format, but exactly mirror the .vd files output by the TIMES generator. 

THey include result files for TIMES 2.1.3 as a reference. 
Note that postprocessing is not currently setup for those older files. 
Postprocessing methods and outputs are slightly different between TIMES 2.0 and TIMES 3.0.

Scenario name standard: 

    scenario-version_number[-optional_adjustment].csv
