TIMES-NZ is a model of New Zealand’s entire energy system, from raw materials, to generation, to consumption. It shows how New Zealand might meet future energy demand while minimising costs.

It was built for New Zealand based on the International Energy Agency’s TIMES framework, which has been used by more than 60 countries worldwide.
TIMES-NZ is designed to select for the lowest-cost energy system, making it a useful complement to other energy modelling. EECA and the Business Energy Council (BEC) are currently the only organisations in New Zealand to have invested the resources and expertise to develop TIMES for New Zealand.

TIMES NZ can be used to explore a huge range of different energy futures, showing how factors such as falling gas supply, oil prices, carbon prices, the cost of EVs and solar (and more) could interact.

We give it information on the New Zealand energy system as it is today, along with plausible projections for what the future technology and fuel options will be, including and emerging fuels such as hydrogen and biomass. It then finds the lowest-cost pathway to restructure the country’s entire energy system to meet expected levels of energy demand, for example demand for transport, manufacturing, residential heating, commercial activity and more. It is built to account for all the linkages and interactions between different parts of the system.

The model doesn’t answer how to run the energy system; instead it can help structure conversations about trade-offs and uncertainties – and the implications of different energy policies.

TIMES NZ 3.0 is the third iteration of the model using New Zealand data and incorporates feedback from users of previous versions. EECA and BEC plan to update TIMES NZ 3.0 regularly to keep pace with major energy developments.
