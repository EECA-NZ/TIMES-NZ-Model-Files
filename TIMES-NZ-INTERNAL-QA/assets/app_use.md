This app is designed to explore all result outputs of TIMES-NZ 3.0. It is an explorer, rather than a narrative tool, and was designed for EECA's internal QA of modelling results.

Each tab covers a different area of the energy system, such as primary production or energy demand. We also include a section on "Energy service demand", which is a measure of final useful output, and is a key metric for how the TIMES model optimises the energy system. 

Each tab contains one or more charts, and each of these can be filtered and grouped in multiple ways. The filter options will update based on your current selection. For example, selecting the Sector Group "Industry" means that the Sector field will only contain industrial sector options. 

It is possible to download the full data for each chart, or download all results data bundled as a zip file. You can also change the scenario displayed, or compare scenarios for any given chart. 


### Explorer tabs 

TIMES outputs have been organised into specific sections for ease of use. These include: 

 - Production (Primary energy production and imports)
 - Electricity generation
 - Energy demand (end use of energy, including non-energy use)
 - Emissions (energy emissions from all sources)
 - "Energy service demand", (final demanded output, such as distance travelled or rooms heated) 


### Time slices 

TIMES-NZ 3.0 models energy supply and demand across different "TimeSlices", or periods of the year. We break the year down into:

 - 4 seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter)
 - 2 types of day (weekend and weekday)
 - 3 times of day (day, night, peak). Here, peak refers to the hour between 6 and 7pm.

In this initial release, these are referred to by their internal codes. For example, SUM-WE-P would refer to summer weekend peak times. You can see detailed timeslice information on tabs where applicable, such as electricity consumption.
