This app is designed to explore all result outputs of TIMES-NZ 3.0. 

For every chart, you can select the way the bars are grouped, and filter the data based on the underlying structure.

Filter options update based on your current selection. For example, if you select the "Industrial" sector group, then only Industral subsectors will be available in the Sector filter options. 

Select any available scenario from the dropdown to explore, or optionally compare two different scenarios in any chart.


### Explorer tabs 

TIMES outputs have been organised into specific sections for ease of use. These include: 

 - Production (Primary energy production and imports)
 - Electricity generation (conversion of one form of energy into electricity)
 - Other transformation (conversion of one form of energy into another, excluding electricity)
 - Energy demand (end use of energy, including non-energy use)
 - Emissions (energy emissions from all sources)
 - "Energy service demand", (final demanded output, such as distance travelled or rooms heated) 
 - Infeasibilities (developer-facing items for debugging)
