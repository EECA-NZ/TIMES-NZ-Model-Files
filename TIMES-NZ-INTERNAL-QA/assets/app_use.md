This app is designed to explore all result outputs of TIMES-NZ 3.0. It is intended as an "explorer", allowing a user or developer to browse or interrogate results. 

### Scenario selection 

Each chart displays the currently selected scenario, and optionally can compare results to a second scenario. 

Currently available scenarios: 

 - traditional-v3_0_0: Traditional scenario
 - traditional-v3_0_0-highcarbon: As Traditional, but with a higher carbon price path. 


### Explorer tabs 

TIMES outputs have been organised into specific sections for ease of use. These include: 

 - Production (Primary energy production and imports)
 - Electricity generation (conversion of one form of energy into electricity)
 - Other transformation (conversion of one form of energy into another, excluding electricity)
 - Energy demand (end use of energy, including non-energy use)
 - Emissions (energy emissions from all sources)
 - "Energy service demand", (final demanded output, such as distance travelled or rooms heated) 
 - Infeasibilities (developer-facing items for debugging)
