This covers final energy demand. 

This includes non-energy use of fuels, such as feedstock gas at Methanex or coal used for steel production. You can identify non-energy use of fuels by selecting the end use category "Feedstock".

However, it excludes energy used for transformation, such as coal used for electricity generation. This energy is not considered "end use".
