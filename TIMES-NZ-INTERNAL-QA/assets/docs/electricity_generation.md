This page covers all generation, including output generation, fuels used for generation, and capacity. Battery capacity is displayed separately.

It includes the option to view electricity generation by timeslice, although this can only be done for one year at a time. 

TIMES-NZ 3.0 models energy supply and demand across different "time slices", or periods of the year. We break the year down into:

 - 4 seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter)
 - 2 types of day (weekend and weekday)
 - 3 times of day (day, night, peak). Here, peak refers to the hour between 6 and 7pm.

In this initial release, these are referred to by their internal codes. For example, SUM-WE-P would refer to summer weekend peak times. You can see detailed timeslice information on tabs where applicable, such as electricity consumption.
