Title,Comments
All Energy Related Cumulative Emissions ,Kea�s more rapidly decreasing emissions indicate cumulative emissions through to 2050 being almost 25% lower in the Kea scenario than the Tūī scenario.
All Energy Related Annual Emissions,Both scenarios show strong reductions in energy emissions. Tūī declines to 10 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>/year in 2050 while Kea declines further to 6.5 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>/year.
Transport Emissions ,Transport emissions fall dramatically in line with the fall in road transport fossil-fuel usage as light and heavy vehicle fleets electrify. In both scenarios the residual emissions are from marine and aviation transport. The steeper reduction in Kea�s transport emissions is from the more rapid uptake of EVs and lower growth in vehicle numbers compared to Tūī.
Industrial Emissions ,Industrial emissions see a sharp decline in Kea to 2.7 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>/year in 2050 due to the uptake of direct use of renewables and electrification. Tūī declines more slowly as the transition takes longer.
Renewable Electricity ,"Both scenarios converge on a very high renewable electricity percentage of around 95%. Under both scenarios, winter gas peaking is retained, and there is a gradual decline in geothermal generation.  Under the Tūī scenario, hydro generation expands further, reducing dependence on gas peakers."
Renewable Energy ,"Both scenarios indicate that between 2018 and 2050, energy demand (excluding feedstocks) met by fossil fuels falls from 63% to 22% under Kea and 33% under Tūī. In some sectors, particularly road transport, food processing, residential and commercial, fossil-fuel demand falls to a small fraction of current levels. Most remaining demand is in hard-to-abate sectors. This means renewables provide 78% of energy demand (excluding feedstocks) under Kea and 67% under Tūī in 2050."
Electrification ,"Electrification across all sectors results in electricity demand roughly doubling in both scenarios, from 144 PJ in 2018 to around 280 PJ in 2060. Electricity supplies up to 59% in Kea and 57% in Tūī of all energy demand by 2060. Under both scenarios, this increased demand is met by very large increases in wind generation accompanied by large increases to solar (primarily grid-scale) in later years."
Estimated Composite GDP,"The two narratives are two different economic paths that governments might take towards a sustainable economy in the long term. Under Tūī, New Zealand balances its international emissions targets with protecting its key wealth-generating sectors from the full effect of international carbon prices. Strong economic growth occurs in the early part of the period, however midway through the scenario period New Zealand becomes less desirable as a trading partner. Under Kea, New Zealand takes the risk of transforming its economy with climate change being the catalyst. Difficult structural change occurs through to 2040. From 2040 onwards, New Zealand begins to return to higher GDP growth with a new low-emissions economy and improving productivity resulting from the transformation."
Total Population,"Under Tūī, due to the continued growth in the New Zealand economy, migrants are initially attracted to the wealth generation prospects in New Zealand. In the first part of the scenario period, immigration and thus population growth, grows strongly at 1.2%. Under Kea, population grows at only 0.6% p.a. during the period of transformation to 2040."
Number of Households ,"We estimated the number of new occupied dwellings under each scenario up to 2060 by dividing population increase projections by the number of new residents per new occupied dwelling, which was calculated from historical data."
Carbon Price,"The assumed international carbon price trajectories are based loosely around the World Energy Council�s �Modern Jazz� and �Unfinished Symphony� scenarios as they reference global prices in Tūī and Kea respectively, but �spread� the prices to reflect how New Zealand positions itself relative to the rest of the world. Tūī lags the international carbon price, reflecting the effort to protect strategic wealth-generating industries from the full effect of the carbon price. Under Kea, the domestic carbon price is allowed to run ahead of the global price of carbon."
GDP/capita,This is calculated by dividing the estimated composite GDP by the population.
VKT light duty fleet ,"All road transport demands were projected from the two Vehicle Fleet Emissions Model (VFEM) scenarios from the Ministry of Transport (MoT). The VFEM scenario �Golden Triangle� was used for Tūī data inputs and the �Staying Close to the Action� was used for Kea data inputs. The selection of these two MoT scenarios enable the narrative that in the Kea scenario, people will generally travel less due to increased urban infrastructure such as cycleways (not modelled in TIMES). In Tūī, people will continue to increase their travel as population and GDP increases."

Hydrogen Electrolyser Costs ,Electrolyser capital costs were determined from discussions with industry participants. A greater cost reduction is forecast in Kea to represent an increased scale of investment into hydrogen production.
Wind Power Costs,Based on the Annual Technology Baseline from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
