# TIMES-NZ-Model-Files

## Excel Model Configuration Files for TIMES-NZ

This repository houses the Excel files defining the TIMES-NZ (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System - New Zealand) energy system model configuration. It is intended for use by researchers and analysts working with energy models in New Zealand. For a guide on getting started with the TIMES-NZ model, refer to the [TIMES-NZ-internal-guide-EECA](https://github.com/EECA-NZ/TIMES-NZ-internal-guide-EEC) repository.

## Integrated Workflow Across Repositories

The TIMES-NZ project is divided across three main repositories, each serving a distinct purpose in the overall modeling and visualization process. The repositories and their functions are as follows:

1. [TIMES-NZ-Model-Files](https://github.com/EECA-NZ/TIMES-NZ-Model-Files): Houses the Excel files defining the TIMES-NZ energy system model configuration, along with additional resources and tools for change tracking.

2. [TIMES-NZ-GAMS-Files](https://github.com/EECA-NZ/TIMES-NZ-GAMS-Files): Contains the GAMS model files for TIMES-NZ scenarios and scripts to enable reproducible scenario execution.

3. [TIMES-NZ-Visualisation](https://github.com/EECA-NZ/TIMES-NZ-Visualisation): Provides a tool for visualizing the results of TIMES-NZ scenarios using an RShiny application.

### High-Level Workflow Overview

#### Step 1: Model Configuration and Release Tagging
- Begin by configuring the TIMES-NZ model in the TIMES-NZ-Model-Files repository, and using VEDA to run the model. Work is done in a development branch and merged to the main branch after review.
- When ready to release a new version of the model, name your scenarios to include the release tag (e.g., kea-v2_1_2).
- Once the configuration is complete and scenarios are named, commit your changes and tag the release (e.g., v2.1.2).

#### Step 2: Scenario Execution with GAMS
- Move to the TIMES-NZ-GAMS-Files repository.
- Fetch the GAMS 'dd' files and the '.run' file associated with the scenario using the `get_from_veda.ps1` PowerShell script.
- Run the GAMS solver using the `run_times_scenario.ps1` PowerShell script, and the output files will be generated.

#### Step 3: Visualization Preparation
- After running the scenario, take the output vd file and copy it into the TIMES-NZ-Visualisation's `data_cleaning` subdirectory.
- Run the data extraction script in the `data_cleaning` subdirectory to process the output and generate a file ready for visualization (e.g., tui-v2_1_2.rda).

#### Step 4: Visualization with RShiny
- Launch the RShiny application to visualize the scenario results interactively.

### Additional Details
For more specific instructions, including the commands and scripts to be used at each step, please refer to the README files in the respective repositories:
- [TIMES-NZ-Model-Files README](https://github.com/EECA-NZ/TIMES-NZ-Model-Files/blob/main/README.md)
- [TIMES-NZ-GAMS-Files README](https://github.com/EECA-NZ/TIMES-NZ-GAMS-Files/blob/main/README.md)
- [TIMES-NZ-Visualisation README](https://github.com/EECA-NZ/TIMES-NZ-Visualisation?files=1#readme)

For any questions or support, you can contact [dataandanalytics@eeca.govt.nz].

**Note:** The above workflow describes current state. In the future we hope to:
* automate the process of generating the Excel configuration files using Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAPs);
* automate the production of GAMS files directly from the excel files without the use of VEDA.


## Dependencies

Before you start working with this project, you will need the following tools installed on your machine:

- **Git**: Used for version control. Download and install from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
- **Docker**: Required for running the `times-excel-reader` tool. Download and install from https://www.docker.com/get-started.

- [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/) installed on your system.
- A valid GAMS license placed in the system's designated location (e.g., `C:\GAMS\42\gamslice.txt`).
- A working VEDA (VEDA 2.0 localhost) installation ([instructions here](https://veda-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/Getting%20started.html)).

Ensure that you are able to use Git via the command line in a PowerShell-like environment. This README assumes Windows 10 or higher.

## Installation

Here's how to get the project installed on your local machine for development:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EECA-NZ/TIMES-NZ-Model-Files.git
cd TIMES-NZ-Model-Files
```

## Working with Git & GitHub

If you're new to Git and GitHub, here's a simple guide on how to get started.

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Git installed on your machine. You can download it from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads.
- If you prefer a graphical user interface, GitHub Desktop is an option, but the use of command-line tools is preferred in order to ensure repeatability. If you want to use GitHub Desktop, you can download it here: https://desktop.github.com/.

### Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository

First, you'll need to make a copy of this repository on your local machine. This is called "cloning". If you're using command line, use the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EECA-NZ/TIMES-NZ-Model-Files.git
```

If you're using GitHub Desktop, you can clone the repository by selecting "File -> Clone Repository" from the menu, and then select the repository from the list.

#### 2. Create a Branch

Before making changes, it's best practice to create a new branch. This keeps your changes isolated until they're ready to be merged into the main branch. Here's how you can do it:

Command line:
```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

GitHub Desktop: Select "Branch -> New Branch" from the menu, and enter your branch name.

#### 3. Make Your Changes

Now you can start making changes to the code. You can create new files, modify existing ones, and delete what you don't need.

#### 4. Document Your Changes

Use the Dockerized `times-excel-reader` tool to generate a summary of the model at `TIMES-NZ/raw_table_summary/raw_tables.txt`. This will help reviewers see the changes you've made to the Excel files by viewing the diff of this text file in the pull request.

After changing the TIMES-NZ model excel files, before committing the changes and making a pull request, please run the following `docker run` command to generate a summary of the new model. Before running the following docker command for the first time, you will need to build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t times_excel_reader .
```
This will also need to be done when there are updates to the Dockerfile or `requirements.txt`. Otherwise, you can just run the container as needed with the following `docker run` command:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name my_times_reader -v ${PWD}/TIMES-NZ:/usr/src/app/TIMES-NZ times_excel_reader
```

Then commit changes that have been made by the script to `TIMES-NZ/raw_table_summary/raw_tables.txt`, alongside your changes to the excel workbooks. These changes will be visible if you run `git diff` before committing.

**Note:**

* If you are unable to run the `times-excel-reader` tool on your machine, you can open a pull request without changing the `raw_tables.txt` file. The GitHub Actions check will fail on your PR, and the check will create an artifact containing the updated `raw_tables.txt`. You can download this and update the one on your branch instead.

* The `times-excel-reader` tool generates file paths with forward slashes (`/`). If you're working on Windows, the file paths in the `raw_tables.txt` may contain backslashes (`\`). To maintain consistency across environments, we recommend running the tool in a Linux-like environment (e.g., using WSL on Windows) or normalizing file paths using a tool like `sed` before committing your changes.


#### 5. Commit Your Changes

After you've made some changes, you need to "commit" them. This takes a snapshot of your changes, which you can then push to GitHub. **Important**: Please take care to ensure that only changes you intend to commit are committed!

Command line:
```bash
# Add changes to the staging area
git status
git add [specific changed file or files related to commit]
# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

GitHub Desktop: In the Changes tab, write a commit message summarizing your changes and click "Commit to [branch name]".

#### 6. Push Your Changes

After committing, you need to "push" your changes to GitHub. This makes them available to others.

Command line:
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <your-branch-name>
```

GitHub Desktop: Click the "Push origin" button in the toolbar.

#### 7. Create a Pull Request

Finally, you can ask for your changes to be merged into the main branch by creating a "pull request". 

Go to the repository on GitHub, and click on the "Pull request" button. Select your branch from the dropdown, write a brief description of your changes, and click "Create pull request".
